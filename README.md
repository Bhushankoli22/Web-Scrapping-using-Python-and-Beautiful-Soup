# Web-Scrapping-using-Python-and-Beautiful-Soup
I was able to learn how to extract particular data from cards of website (Fake Python) and put them in excel sheet i.e csv format using Python,Jupyter Notebook and Beautiful Soup. 
Following the basic steps to perform Web Scarpping.
1) First of all we need to open Jupyter Notebook, then install certain packages like requests and bs4(beautifulsoup). 
2) After installing, import beautifulsoup as bs and requests as req, as we are going to send requests of a particular url to the Web Search Engines.
3) Next is we have to provide the target. i.e provide the url of particular website through which we want to extract the data.
4) For that use get method for the URL and save it in variable.
5) Then we have to apply Beautiful Soup to the targeted URL i.e variable
